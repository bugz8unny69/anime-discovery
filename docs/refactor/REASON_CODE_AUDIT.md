# Reason and event code audit

> **Applied** by RF-006b (migration `064`): the catalog in `reasons.py` and `messages.py` is the new wording below, and stored codes were rewritten. The retired per-service codes in §1a follow in RF-006c (migration `065`). This page stays as the reviewed record; `test_reason_code_audit` keeps the catalog and `reason_code_proposals.py` in step.

**Base:** `refactor` at `8c1d25a0` (NextGen `29fce109`, with `services` merged). First written against `9fdb64eb` (NextGen `9071be2e`); §0 lists the codes added since. This is a review document: it changes no code.
**Kept current by** `src/nextgen/tests/test_reason_code_audit.py`: it fails when a registered code has no proposal here, so a NextGen sync that adds a code cannot slip past the audit.
**Data:** [`reason_code_proposals.py`](reason_code_proposals.py) is the machine-readable source. Rebuild this page with `python docs/refactor/render_reason_code_audit.py > docs/refactor/REASON_CODE_AUDIT.md`. RF-006 applies the data.

## Decisions this audit implements

- Persisted identifiers are **renamed**. One versioned SQL migration rewrites the stored values, including `job_history`. The code recognizes **only the new values**, and old names are removed.
- **"Trial" becomes "user evaluation"** (`USER_EVALUATION_*`) everywhere it can. The other places the term is used are mapped in [NAMING_MAP.md](NAMING_MAP.md) §8.
- Every code's wording is rewritten to be human-readable: plain words, the service named, and a concrete next step.
- **Codes name the situation or the role, never the product** (owner decision, 2026-11-06), so a service can be replaced without renaming codes. Service-health conditions use four generic codes, `SERVICE_SETUP_INVALID`, `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, `SERVICE_RESPONSE_INVALID` and the role code `RELEASE_SEARCH_TIMEOUT`, and the service goes in the details. Exception: `RELEASE_ANIDB_EPISODE_MISSING` and `RELEASE_TVDB_EPISODE_MISSING` name the episode numbering the whole data model is keyed on (`anidb_id`, `tvdb_season`), not a replaceable service.
- **Jobs that stopped under the old Sonarr-based discovery** migrate to one historical code, `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_OUTDATED`, so History stays true (owner decision, 2026-11-06).
- **Behavior changes are allowed** where they improve things (owner decision, 2026-11-06). They are made on `refactor` only, never on NextGen, and listed in §6. Elsewhere, severity and retryable flags are unchanged.

## 1. Renamed codes

| Old | New | Kind | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PROWLARR_SEARCH_TIMEOUT` | `RELEASE_SEARCH_TIMEOUT` | reason | No product names in codes (owner decision, 2026-11-06). The search service is named in the details. |
| `PROWLARR_RELEASE_WITHDRAWN` | `RELEASE_WITHDRAWN` | reason | No product names in codes. It describes the release, not the search service. |
| `SONARR_BACKFILL_PLAN_CONFLICT` | `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_PLAN_CONFLICT` | reason | Episode discovery searches Prowlarr, not Sonarr. |
| `SONARR_CANDIDATES_EXHAUSTED` | `RELEASE_CANDIDATES_EXHAUSTED` | reason | Release candidates come from Prowlarr, not Sonarr. |
| `SHOKO_METADATA_REVIEW` | `METADATA_ENRICHMENT_REVIEW` | reason | No product names in codes. Shoko is the anime library service that adds episode details. |
| `JELLYFIN_REFRESH_REVIEW` | `MEDIA_SERVER_REFRESH_REVIEW` | reason | No product names in codes. Jellyfin is the media server. |
| `TORRENT_PROVENANCE_CONFLICT` | `TORRENT_OWNERSHIP_CONFLICT` | reason | "Provenance" is jargon. The check is whether the torrent still matches what this work added. |
| `TRIAL_SELECTED` | `USER_EVALUATION_SELECTED` | reason | "Trial" is replaced by "user evaluation" everywhere (owner decision). |
| `TRIAL_OUTSIDE_WINDOW` | `USER_EVALUATION_OUTSIDE_WINDOW` | reason | "Trial" is replaced by "user evaluation" everywhere (owner decision). |
| `TRIAL_DISABLED` | `USER_EVALUATION_DISABLED` | reason | "Trial" is replaced by "user evaluation" everywhere (owner decision). |
| `TRIAL_PLAN_CONFLICT` | `USER_EVALUATION_PLAN_CONFLICT` | reason | "Trial" is replaced by "user evaluation" everywhere (owner decision). |
| `TRIAL_COUNTS_INVALID` | `USER_EVALUATION_COUNTS_INVALID` | reason | "Trial" is replaced by "user evaluation" everywhere (owner decision). |
| `SONARR_SELECTION_CONFLICT` | `RELEASE_SELECTION_CONFLICT` | reason | Releases come from Prowlarr, not Sonarr. Registered by NextGen #283; it appears only in the worker log, because the job itself ends with `JOB_HANDLER_FAILED`. |
| `BATCH_SELECTION_CONFLICT` | `SEASON_PACK_SELECTION_CONFLICT` | reason | Matches `RELEASE_SELECTION_CONFLICT`, and says "season pack", the word the dashboard uses, instead of the internal "batch". Same log-only use. |
| `TORRENT_INTENT_RECORDED` | `TORRENT_SUBMISSION_RECORDED` | event | "Intent" is jargon. The event records that the torrent is about to be added. |
| `TRIAL_EVALUATED` | `USER_EVALUATION_CHECKED` | event | "Trial" is replaced by "user evaluation" everywhere (owner decision). |
| `TRIAL_AUDIO_SEARCH` | `USER_EVALUATION_AUDIO_SEARCH` | event | "Trial" is replaced by "user evaluation" everywhere (owner decision). |
| `SONARR_BACKFILL_OBSERVED` | `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_RECORDED` | event | Episode discovery searches Prowlarr. The old text said "Read-only Sonarr backfill results recorded." |

## 1a. Retired product-named codes

Each is replaced by a generic code. The migration rewrites stored rows to it and, where the old code named the service, adds `"service"` to the row's details, so History still says which service it was.

| Retired | Replaced by | `service` in details | Old severity / retryable | New |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PROWLARR_CONFIGURATION_INVALID` | `SERVICE_SETUP_INVALID` | prowlarr | WARNING / False | **ERROR / False** |
| `PROWLARR_AUTH_FAILED` | `SERVICE_SETUP_INVALID` | prowlarr | WARNING / False | **ERROR / False** |
| `PROWLARR_SEARCH_REVIEW` | `SERVICE_RESPONSE_INVALID` | prowlarr | WARNING / False | **WARNING / None** |

| `JELLYFIN_UNAVAILABLE` | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | jellyfin | WARNING / True | WARNING / True |
| `KEEP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | sonarr | WARNING / True | WARNING / True |
| `TORRENT_METADATA_CONFIGURATION_INVALID` | `SERVICE_SETUP_INVALID` | qbittorrent | WARNING / False | **ERROR / False** |
| `TORRENT_METADATA_CLIENT_UNSUPPORTED` | `SERVICE_SETUP_INVALID` | qbittorrent | WARNING / False | **ERROR / False** |
| `TORRENT_METADATA_UNAVAILABLE` | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | qbittorrent | WARNING / True | WARNING / True |

| `DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_RESPONSE_INVALID` | `SERVICE_RESPONSE_INVALID` | qbittorrent | WARNING / False | **WARNING / None** |
| `DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_AUTH_FAILED` | `SERVICE_SETUP_INVALID` | qbittorrent | WARNING / False | **ERROR / False** |
| `DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_UNSUPPORTED` | `SERVICE_SETUP_INVALID` | qbittorrent | WARNING / False | **ERROR / False** |
| `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | from the details, if recorded | WARNING / True | WARNING / True |
| `PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_INVALID` | `SERVICE_SETUP_INVALID` | from the details, if recorded | ERROR / False | ERROR / False |
| `PROVIDER_RESPONSE_INVALID` | `SERVICE_RESPONSE_INVALID` | from the details, if recorded | WARNING / None | WARNING / None |
| `PROVIDER_AUTH_FAILED` | `SERVICE_SETUP_INVALID` | from the details, if recorded | WARNING / False | **ERROR / False** |

## 1b. Codes added by this refactor

| Code | Severity / retryable | Description | Message | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SERVICE_RESPONSE_INVALID` | WARNING / None | A service sent back a response that could not be read or did not make sense. The details name the service. | A service sent a response that could not be used. | Check that the service named in the details is working and up to date, then press Retry. |
| `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_OUTDATED` | WARNING / False | This episode search stopped under the old Sonarr-based discovery, which Prowlarr search has replaced. | This search ran under the old episode discovery. | Press Search again to search with the current release search. |

## 2. Removed codes and where their stored rows migrate

| Removed | Migrates to | Last emitted / evidence | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_AUTH_FAILED` | `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_OUTDATED` | Before `db41b589` (Sonarr-based discovery) | A retry now searches Prowlarr. |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_CONFIGURATION_INVALID` | `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_OUTDATED` | Before `db41b589` | Same as above. |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_UNSUPPORTED` | `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_OUTDATED` | Before `db41b589` | The wrong server version was a setup problem. |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_REVIEW` | `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_OUTDATED` | Before `db41b589` |  |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT` | `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_OUTDATED` | Before `db41b589`; still listed in `review_retry` |  |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_UNAVAILABLE` | `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_OUTDATED` | Before `db41b589`; still listed in `review_retry` |  |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_NO_RESULTS` | `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_OUTDATED` | Before `db41b589` | Same meaning: the ranked fallback is no longer offered. |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_EPISODE_NOT_FOUND` | `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_OUTDATED` | Before `db41b589`; still listed in `review_retry` | Sonarr's catalog is no longer consulted. `review_retry` keeps these BLOCKED jobs retry-eligible under the new code, as they are today. |
| `SONARR_EPISODES_NOT_LISTED` | `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_OUTDATED` | Before `db41b589`; still listed in `review_retry` | Same as above. |
| `KEEP_NOT_READY` | `KEEP_IMPORT_REVIEW` | Only on 2026-10-23 (`bf89c34b` to `e1a8bd3b`), before Keep existed | The person reviews the job and presses Keep again. |
| `ACTIVITY_CHANGED` | `DEFERRED` | Registered in `df9655aa` but never emitted | No rows are expected. The target is only a safe fallback. |

## 3. What the migration must rewrite (RF-006)

For every renamed or removed code, the RF-006 migration rewrites the columns below. It will be `063`: `060` and `061` are the batch candidate tables and `062` is `service_status`.

- **History:** `job_history.event_code` and `.reason_code`; `event_history.event_code` and `.reason_code`.
- **Current state:** `jobs.last_reason_code`, `incoming_events.last_reason_code` and `job_operations.reason_code`.
- **Per-step records:**
  - `trial_evaluations.reason_code`, renamed in RF-006 (NAMING_MAP §8);
  - `sonarr_episode_candidates.reason_code`, renamed in RF-006;
  - `torrent_submissions.reason_code` and `torrent_transfers.reason_code`;
  - `batch_torrent_submissions.reason_code`, `batch_torrent_transfers.reason_code` and `batch_torrent_unlocks.reason_code`;
  - `batch_candidates.reason_code` and `batch_candidate_stops.reason_code`, why a season pack candidate stopped (added by the batch candidate controller, migrations `060` and `061`).
- **Codes inside JSON:** `job_history.details_json` and `event_history.details_json` (`cause_reason_code`). Also any stored JSON that embeds codes, such as `prowlarr_search_snapshots.snapshot_json`, `identity_candidate_evidence.evidence_json` and `batch_candidates.metadata_json`. RF-006 scans **every** `*_json` column with `json_tree` for old code values before writing the update, rather than trusting this list.

These columns were inventoried from the current schema (every column named `*reason*`, `event_code` or `*_code`). `activity_code` and `handler_code` hold activity and handler codes, not reason codes. `handler_code` changes only for the job-kind renames (`DISCOVER_SONARR_BACKFILL`, `EVALUATE_TRIAL`, `STAGE_TRIAL_MEDIA`).

The same release removes the old names from the code:

- `reasons.py` and `messages.py`;
- `review_retry.py` (its historical `SONARR_DISCOVERY_*` list goes away, because migrated rows carry `PROWLARR_*`);
- `job_recovery.py`, `job_report.py`, `dashboard.js`, `fixes/` and the tests.

For a **retired** code (§1a) the migration also sets `"service"` in `details_json` from the old code when the old code named one, and keeps any service already recorded.

Log files already on disk keep the old names. A migration cannot change them.

## 4. Full catalog: old and new wording

Each entry shows the **old** text first and the **new** text after it. D = description (what happened), M = message (status line), A = action (what to do). Uses = references in non-test code, `fixes/`, the dashboard and SQL.

| `PROVIDER_RESPONSE_INVALID` | A provider response failed bounded decoding or structural checks. | `SERVICE_RESPONSE_INVALID` |
| `PROVIDER_AUTH_FAILED` | Provider authentication or authorization failed. | `SERVICE_SETUP_INVALID` |

### 4.4 Removed reason codes (old wording, for reference)

| Code | Old description |
|---|---|
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_AUTH_FAILED` | Sonarr rejected the configured API key. |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_CONFIGURATION_INVALID` | The Sonarr address, API key, quality profile or library root folder is missing or not accepted by Sonarr. |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_UNSUPPORTED` | The connected Sonarr server is not a supported v4 instance. |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_REVIEW` | Sonarr interactive search returned ambiguous or invalid mapping or release evidence. |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT` | The Sonarr request exceeded its transport timeout; release searches allow 180 seconds. |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_UNAVAILABLE` | Sonarr or its interactive search could not complete the request. |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_NO_RESULTS` | The previously ranked fallback torrent is not currently offered by Sonarr. |
| `SONARR_DISCOVERY_EPISODE_NOT_FOUND` | The requested TVDB series is absent from Sonarr; its release API requires existing catalog records. |
| `SONARR_EPISODES_NOT_LISTED` | Sonarr returned no matching episode record for one or more requested backfill episodes. |
| `KEEP_NOT_READY` | Media promotion requires the future verified staging and permanent-publication library. |

## 5. Open decisions

1. **Wording review.** Please read §4, §1a and §1b and mark anything that is unclear or wrong, including the names `SEASON_PACK_SELECTION_CONFLICT`, `METADATA_ENRICHMENT_REVIEW` and `MEDIA_SERVER_REFRESH_REVIEW`.
2. **How fine-grained the generic codes are.** A wrong API key and a missing address are both `SERVICE_SETUP_INVALID`; the details say which. A separate `SERVICE_AUTH_FAILED` is possible if you want to filter on it.
3. **Severity of `SERVICE_SETUP_INVALID`.** It is ERROR, because it was created for the worker refusing to start. The optional-service setup codes it replaces were WARNING. Proposed: keep ERROR, since a service that is set up wrong always needs you to act.

Decided (owner):

- 2026-11-04: "trial" is replaced by "user evaluation" (`USER_EVALUATION`).
- 2026-11-06: no product names in codes; the per-service codes are retired into generic service codes.
- 2026-11-06: jobs stopped under the old Sonarr-based discovery migrate to `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_OUTDATED`.
- 2026-11-06: behavior changes are allowed on `refactor` where they improve things; NextGen is not changed.

## 6. Behavior changes RF-006 must make

These go beyond renaming, and are allowed on `refactor` (owner decision, 2026-11-06):

1. **Handlers report the generic code.** Every place that raises a retired code reports its replacement instead, with `service` (the adapter name) and a readable detail, such as `qBittorrent 4.3 is not supported; 4.5 or newer is required`. Facts that were in the old wording move into that detail. The service adapters (`services/adapters/`) already classify errors per service; their code-to-status maps change to the generic codes.
2. **Severity and retryable** change where §1a shows them in bold.
3. **Rules that match on codes** use the new ones:
   - `review_retry` (its discovery BLOCKED list becomes `RELEASE_SEARCH_TIMEOUT`, `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` and `EPISODE_DISCOVERY_OUTDATED`);
   - `job_recovery`, `job_report`, the dashboard filters and `fixes/`.
4. **Dashboard and History show the service** for `SERVICE_*` codes, from the details, because the message no longer names it.
5. **The service-wait path** (`worker._service_wait`) no longer needs the per-service code as a `cause_reason_code`, because the handler reports `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` with the service directly. Waiting, the 72-hour give-up and `adm recover` stay as they are.

Proposed follow-up, not part of this audit: **services behind role adapters**. Each role has a small interface the rest of the code calls, and the adapter for the current service implements it:

- download client (qBittorrent);
- release search (Prowlarr);
- library manager for Keep (Sonarr);
- media server (Jellyfin);
- anime library service (Shoko);
- metadata (AniDB, TVDB, Anime-Lists).

Replacing a service then means writing an adapter, with no code renames. The adapters stay in the repository (no third-party plugin loading), and each interface starts with what the code calls today.
