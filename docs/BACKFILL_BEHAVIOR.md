# Backfill and continue: intended behavior

Automatic backfill and continue search Prowlarr directly. Sonarr takes no part
in finding or downloading these episodes. The separate, user-triggered **Keep**
import is unchanged and still uses Sonarr.

## Episode selection

The searched window is the union of:

- backfill: episodes 1 through X of the verified TVDB season (`trial.backfill_count`);
- continue: the incoming episode and the following ones (`trial.following_count`
  includes the incoming episode).

Overlaps count once. The incoming episode itself is never searched: its own
delivery is already acquiring it. Example: backfill=6, incoming=5,
following_count=3 searches 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7.

Episodes with an active reservation (single or batch) are skipped and reported
as `IN_PROGRESS`. Staged and kept episodes keep their reservation, so they are
skipped too. A canceled episode releases its reservation and is searched again.

Frozen plans keep their captured counts and season. The window is searched in
pages of four episodes; each page is one `DISCOVER_SONARR_BACKFILL` job (the
historical job and table names are kept so existing jobs and history stay valid).

## How an episode is searched

1. The episode catalog (`providers/backfill_catalog.py`) maps the TVDB episode
   to its AniDB episode number with the same cached AniDB record, Anime-Lists
   offsets and TVDB official episode list that VERIFY_RELEASE uses, and reads
   the AniDB air date.
2. Prowlarr is queried with GET `/api/v1/search` (at most six queries per
   episode): two AniDB titles plus the AniDB episode number, and for sequels the
   franchise title plus the absolute number and `SxxEyy`.
3. Each result title is parsed the way release groups write it
   (`acquisition/release_titles.py`): `[Group] Title - 05 (1080p)`,
   `Title 2nd Season - 05`, `Title S2 - 05`, `Title II - 05`, `Title - S02E05`,
   scene-style `The.Title.S02E05.1080p`, `Romaji | English - 05`, `v2` suffixes.
   It matches only when the title is one of the anime's AniDB titles (or its
   franchise title with the right season marker) and the number is this
   episode as an AniDB number, TVDB `SxxEyy`, season-relative number or
   absolute number (`- 29` for season 2 episode 5 after a 24-episode season).
   A bare franchise title without a season marker only matches the absolute
   number, so season 1 episode 5 is never taken for season 2 episode 5.
   Batches, ranges, `.5` recaps, OVAs, movies and specials never match.
   Unclear titles are skipped, never sent for review.
4. Resolution is read from the title (480p … 2160p, 4K/UHD). Releases without a
   resolution, above `prowlarr.max_resolution`, below `prowlarr.min_seeders`,
   or whose Prowlarr-reported size is over `acquisition.max_episode_mb` are
   counted but never sent to qBittorrent. The rest are ranked by
   `prowlarr.rank_by`. A release with no reported size is not skipped; the
   size limit is still checked after its file list is read.
5. The magnet comes from `magnetUrl`, a magnet `guid`, or the `infoHash`
   (bare hash). Conflicting hashes drop the result.
6. The best release goes through the existing pipeline unchanged: an internal
   delivery named plainly (`<AniDB title> - 05`, the group's title kept
   alongside) is verified by VERIFY_RELEASE, reserved, sent to qBittorrent with
   its sanitized magnet, downloaded, verified and staged. Lower-ranked releases
   are kept as fallbacks: if any later step fails (bad metadata, size limit,
   failed verification), the attempt is cleaned up and the next ranked release
   is tried automatically. Only when every ranked release has failed does the
   episode stop for review.

Webhook intake uses the same reader: `declared_episode()`, the identity
aliases and season hints, and the batch router (`release_scope_hint`) all call
`release_titles.read_release()`, so a title readable for backfill is readable
at intake too. Season packs keep the existing batch path.

## Results are reported per episode

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CANDIDATES` | Matching releases found; the best usable one was sent on |
| `NO_RESULTS` | Prowlarr returned no matching release |
| `NOT_AIRED` | AniDB has no past air date, or TVDB does not list the episode yet |
| `MAPPING_MISSING` | TVDB lists the episode but the AniDB/TVDB mapping is missing or ambiguous |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | Already reserved, staged or kept |

One episode without releases never holds back the others on the page.

A slow or busy Prowlarr is retried, not reported straight away:

1. Each search waits up to `prowlarr.timeout_seconds` (default 60). A
   timeout, 429 or 5xx gets two more tries, 15 s and then 60 s later; a 429
   `Retry-After` replaces the wait, capped at two minutes.
2. If all three tries fail, nothing from that page is published and the job
   runs again once, 30 minutes later.
3. If that also fails, it stops as BLOCKED with Retry available:
   `PROWLARR_SEARCH_TIMEOUT` or `PROWLARR_UNAVAILABLE`. A manual Retry gets
   the same allowance again.

`PROWLARR_AUTH_FAILED`, `PROWLARR_CONFIGURATION_INVALID` and unreadable
responses are never retried automatically: fix Settings, then Retry.

Not-aired episodes are reported, not polled. Continue still admits later
episodes when they arrive through the webhook.

## Seeing why a release was rejected

Open **History** on any job of a backfill episode. "Releases tried for
episode N" lists every ranked release in order: the group's title, whether it
was staged, failed (with the reason and, for size stops, the actual sizes),
is in progress or was not tried yet, and the trace ID (`AD-<n>`) of that
attempt for the worker log:
`journalctl -u anime-discovery-worker | grep 'trace_id=AD-<n>'`.

## Settings

Settings → Prowlarr: address, API key, search timeout, maximum resolution,
minimum seeders and ranking. Configuration v11 moves the former
`sonarr.discovery_*` preferences there, keeping their values. Secrets v8 adds
the Prowlarr API key; older secret files stay readable.

## Known limits

- Titles only in non-Latin scripts, or groups that put the episode only in
  brackets (`[Title][05]`), are not matched; other groups usually cover them.
- Media that was already in the library before NextGen (no reservation) is not
  detected and may be searched again.
- No live homelab end-to-end run has been performed.
