"""Cancellation cleanup: delete what this work owns. Nothing more.

Ownership is the ad-<marker> the app gave the work: its torrent is tagged
ad-<marker> and downloads into a folder named ad-<marker>. Cleanup
  1. deletes each such torrent and its files from qBittorrent,
  2. deletes each ad-<marker> download folder whatever it contains,
  3. deletes the staging copies this work wrote (video, episode NFO,
     temporary files) and a series folder left holding only tvshow.nfo.
Anything already gone counts as done, so running it again is harmless.
Only two guards: a torrent without our tag is not ours (left alone), and
nothing outside the staging folder it was written to, or inside the Keep
folder, is touched.
