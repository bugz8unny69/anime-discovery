"""Read-only diagnostics for `adm report job`: why a job is where it is.

Everything here is a SELECT against persisted state plus the documented
resume paths in the code (named below). Nothing is written, retried, released
or called. When the data cannot answer a question the result says so with
NOT_RECORDED / UNKNOWN instead of guessing.

Documented resume paths this module reasons about:
- storage/episode_reservations.skip_staged_waiters: when an owner's single-episode
  acquisition publishes to staging, held exact duplicates are closed DONE /
  SKIPPED_DUPLICATE.
- storage/reservation_release.release_cancelled -> wake_waiters: when an owner's
  operation is CANCELED with cleanup COMPLETE, its single-episode reservations
  are released and held duplicates whose own operation is ACTIVE go to PENDING.
- storage/job_queue.recover_expired: expired RUNNING leases are retried by the worker.
- storage/review_retry: Retry covers NEEDS_REVIEW (and a few BLOCKED search reasons).
Nothing releases a reservation on time, restart or owner completion.
