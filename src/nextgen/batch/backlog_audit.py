"""Batch backlog audit, dry run and safe consolidation (WI-08, WI-16).

`adm recover batch-audit` (a preview) lists, read-only, what consolidation would change:
for each anime season, the operations and jobs found, the one operation that
stays (the primary), the duplicate operations that would be cancelled and
the candidates that would be registered with the series-scoped controller.

`adm recover batch-audit --apply` plans again and applies in one write
transaction, and prints what it applied. It is safe while jobs run: other
writers wait for that transaction, and running jobs are never interrupted.
Duplicates are never marked
cleaned directly: their cancellation is requested through the established
lifecycle and the existing cleanup job does the rest. Running jobs drain
first, only torrents the journals own are deleted, reservations are
released, and a failed cleanup stays pending or goes to review. Candidate
history, timestamps and failure reasons are kept. Consolidation never runs
automatically, for example during a schema migration.
