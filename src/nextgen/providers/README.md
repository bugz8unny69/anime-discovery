# AniDB-first identity libraries

This library supplies a concrete resolver for the opt-in identify_anime_job.
It adapts the legacy title parser, AniDB catalog/compression/exact episode checks,
SQLite request reservation/cooldown, TVDB response/token caching and explicit
mapping/cross-check behavior. It imports no legacy runtime code.

## Composition and current input

`providers.configuration.build_identity_worker(config_directory)` validates the
required provider configuration and returns an unstarted worker. Close it if not
serving it. `run_identity_worker(config_directory)` supplies the normal worker
signal/shutdown entry point. Both providers are always required; there are no
enable flags and no TVDB PIN field or login parameter. Startup validation checks
local configuration/credential availability; it sends no HTTP requests and does
not prove the API key is accepted upstream.

Configuration v4 registers anidb.client_name (blank until configured),
anidb.client_version (1) and providers.timeout_seconds (30). All apply to new
operations without restart. A registered AniDB client name and a nonblank TVDB
API key in the protected SecretStore are required before identity work starts.
Shared caches/throttle state persist as before. See ../SECRETS.md.

Before each claim the composed worker validates its fresh effective settings
and credential availability. Failure leaves queued jobs untouched and stops the
service loop for operator correction. The identity resolver captures its attempt's
current Options and Credentials(api_key) once before provider work. A later change
applies to the next attempt; active work retains its captured values. The bounded
client registry preserves caches across identical options and keeps old in-flight
clients valid when settings change. TVDB caches remain credential-fingerprint scoped.

Lower-level make_resolver accepts either fixed validated Options or a trusted
options(configuration) function, plus a thread-safe credentials() callback.
Share one resolver across attempts. The default composed pipeline now installs VERIFY_RELEASE after IDENTIFY_ANIME.
A custom release kind must be explicitly installed. There is no environment fallback,
legacy config/secret import, dashboard/ADM API endpoint or deployed service unit.

The initial default normalizer requires a JSON body containing release_name.
It does not claim compatibility with every producer's webhook. A future intake
adapter can normalize supported producers or supply a trusted title_extractor.
Duplicate JSON keys, invalid JSON and missing names fail closed. Body size remains
bounded by the identity job. Filename episode/season hints never prove identity.

## Verification order

1. Extract bounded title aliases, using the adapted legacy parser. Query the
   cached official AniDB title dump first. Require one exact normalized anime
   candidate; multiple/no candidates go to review, without guessing from TVDB.
2. Fetch/reuse the ID-specific AniDB HTTP anime record. Validate response anime
   ID, a main title and consistency with the title index.
3. Read the cached Anime-Lists mapping. Require exactly one mapping row with a
   positive TVDB ID for that AniDB anime.
4. Authenticate to TVDB and fetch the exact extended series. Validate ID, explicit
   animation genre, no conflicting live-action classification, corroborating
   AniDB titles and no contradictory explicitly labeled AniDB remote link.
5. Return AnimeSeries v2 with verified series facts and zero release episodes.
   The release job must establish exact episode coverage before acquisition.

A title overlap alone is insufficient; success requires independently fetched
AniDB identity, explicit mapping, and ID-specific TVDB checks. Ambiguity, missing
metadata or conflict yields review. Multiple AniDB anime may legitimately share
one TVDB series ID; the resolver does not merge them or impose whole-anime locks.
The legacy title parser strips season labels for candidate discovery; explicit
S02/Season 2-or-later hints currently go to review rather than accidentally
approving the first entry. Part/season disambiguation and broader matching are
future release/identity evidence work, not guessed here.

## Caching and throttling

| Source | Cache | Request admission | Failure behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AniDB anime HTTP | Validated full-anime XML in SQLite, 24 hours; regular episode IDs reuse the same response | Shared SQLite reservation, at least 10 seconds apart | Shared 10-minute error cooldown; honors longer Retry-After |
| AniDB title dump | Public XML in SQLite, 24 hours | A shared reservation prevents another download within 24 hours, including after a failed attempt | Fail closed; preserve the daily reservation |
| Anime-Lists mapping | Public XML in SQLite, 24 hours | Shared one-minute download spacing | Bounded shared cooldown |
| TVDB | Process-local authorization-scoped series cache, 15 minutes; tokens 30 minutes | Shared SQLite one-second spacing, including login | Honor bounded Retry-After and shared backoff; a rejected bearer token is discarded |

These are conservative application policies adapted from legacy, not a claim
that they coordinate other applications using the same public IP. All local
workers sharing the NextGen database share reservation/cooldown state. No thread
sleeps while holding a job slot for rate pacing: ProviderDeferred returns to the
job, which requests DEFERRED/RETRY_WAIT. For example, cold TVDB login reserves a
request, caches the token in memory and defers its GET until the next allowance;
the next job attempt reuses the token. Actual HTTP work is bounded and offloaded;
forced cancellation waits for the owning thread before releasing admission.

Cache hits precede upstream reservation. Public XML is revalidated on reuse;
invalid responses never replace good entries. Newer reservation generations
prevent late responses overwriting newer cache data. Clock rollback does not make
future-fetched cache entries usable. Public cache is bounded to 130 rows/128 MiB.
TVDB memory cache is a thread-safe 128-entry LRU, with detached results and keys
scoped by credential fingerprint; credentials/tokens are never persisted.
The regular episode helper validates exact positive AniDB epno/eid ownership,
rejects duplicate IDs/numbers and does not invent specials or TVDB numbering.
A missing regular episode remains missing until the anime cache refreshes.

## HTTP, diagnostics and storage

Endpoints are fixed in code. Redirects are rejected, particularly for authenticated
TVDB calls. Responses and decompressed bytes are bounded. Gzip/deflate handling
and AniDB regular-episode validation adapt the legacy implementation; unknown
content encoding, DTD/entity XML, wrong IDs, duplicate/nonfinite JSON and malformed
records fail closed. The legacy AniDB metadata endpoint is plain HTTP; only
public metadata and registered client identifiers are sent there, never TVDB
credentials or user account credentials. Network authenticity limitations of
that endpoint are not solved by schema validation.

ProviderDeferred maps to JOB_WAITING without spending failure retry budget.
ProviderUnavailable and ProviderInvalidResponse produce reason-coded retries;
authentication/authorization failure produces review with PROVIDER_AUTH_FAILED.
Storage failures retain the infrastructure-error path. No HTTP response body,
URL, credentials, token or exception text is logged or saved in diagnostic history.
Existing catalog messages/actions are reused and new reasons are translation-ready.

Schema v9 adds provider_limits and provider_public_cache. The versioned 009
migration, fresh schema, runner/version guards and offline cases accompany these
helpers. No runtime CREATE TABLE, implicit migration or legacy metadata import.
Provider operations require the caller's job admission; HTTP occurs outside
SQLite transactions. Schema is now v10 for release evidence; configuration is v4
and AnimeSeries remains v2.

This draft has not contacted providers, run SQL, executed/imported application
code, run tests/CI or changed media/production. Tests are authored but unexecuted.
Integration/operational confidence is deferred under current project policy.


## Declared episode verifier

providers/releases.py shares the same ClientPool with the identity resolver in
the composed worker, reusing AniDB XML/mapping state, TVDB tokens and caches.
It adapts legacy explicit/offset mapping rules without assuming that missing
offsets are zero or that AniDB numbering equals TVDB numbering. TVDB episode
records are queried in explicit official order, cached per page/credentials for
five minutes and enumerated across at most 20 pages/10000 records. Next links are
opaque continuation signals; they never become request URLs. Every request is
built from the fixed endpoint and a bounded local page number. All pages must
complete before a unique episode match is accepted; duplicate IDs/matches,
wrong-series records and excessive pagination fail closed.

Normal pacing can defer between pages; the next attempt reuses already cached
pages. The resulting scope is DECLARED_SINGLE_EPISODE, not actual torrent/media
file coverage. See ../jobs/VERIFY_RELEASE.md for the deliberately limited stage.
